# AirBrakes

## Main Idea
1. Create a trajectory with boundary condition apogee
2. Discretize the input control trajectory and save as CSV
3. Logic based controller to select the appropriate Deployment levels

## Simulation 
 - RocketPy simulation: Needs to be worked on. 
 - OpenRocket simulation: Already done, not yet on git 

## Control System
 - Trajectory optimisation: folder has the code for the input control trajectory 
 - Control system design: for the on-board controller needs to be completed
 
## Firmware
 - Controller firmware development will start once the controller has been designed

## CFD 
 - Analysis team has done stability analysis and will be shortly providing us with the data.
